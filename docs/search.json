In addition the average booking price using the unfiltered data is $145.5\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nJust like the per night price distribution, majority charge lower prices for their service than high charges given that about 75% of host charge $1,140 or below for a whole week. while there is a minimum amount of $200 there is also a massive difference when we look at the maximum price of $4,200. Additionally from the weekly distribution plot there are about 1,181 hosts that charge between $900 to $919 which is the most used weekly charges.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nUsing the unfilterd data, there is a big difference between the minimum ($650) and maximum ($15,000) monthly price by hosts. Also from the plot, 75% charge $3,990 and below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLodging price by location.\n\nPrice per nightWeekly PriceMonthly Price\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nBefore looking at the median value of various locations, it is important to note that there are locations with very few hosts which influence the median price to have a higher value than locations with more hosts where the price are more distributed.\n\n\n\nProperty listing period:\nGiven the number of period a host have been listed on airbnb, are longer period associated with higher price, lower price or are the prices just random. If we are to use years of hosting experience as a factor that affect cost of creating such service.\n\n\nNumber of period beign a host.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe number of periods after listing a property can also be seen as the number of periods on service experience and infomation about running a successful hosting service with minimum costs can be gained, so looking at the distribution summary for the number of days after listing, majority e.i 75% have been listed for more than 2 years or close to 3 years. furthermore, the general average period for all host is less than 2 years if the outliers of longer periods are put into consideration. so we can say that a majority of host are very much are working towards their second year.\n\n\n\nPeriods & price structure\n\npriceWeekly Average PriceMonthly Average Price\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      host_since_days\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      host_since_days\n      1.000\n    \n    \n      price\n      -0.001\n    \n    \n      weekly_price\n      0.020\n    \n    \n      monthly_price\n      -0.008\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nThere is not an obvious relationship between the number of days after listing a property and the price structure of the booking the property, investigating further might suggest reason such as competition driving price, guest affordability, state/industry price benchmark and so on.\n\n\n\n\nExtra guest and extra charges:\nThe added cost and provisions involved in having extra guests for a reservation.\n\n\nNumber of accommodated guest\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nWhen we look at the number of guests that can be comfortable accommodated without forgoing the quality of their experience, the aggregated average indicate that about 48% of hosts can comfortably host just two guest while 90% of hosts are willing to accommodate from 1 to 4 guests.\n\n\nMinimum number of nights reservation.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFor the minimum number of nights guest choose to spend, 49% of guests opt for a minimum of 1 night while 91% made a decision to spend from 1 night to 3 nights.\n\n\n\n\nmore guests more reservation cost?\n\n\nAccommodationMimimum nights\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThere is a steady increase in the average price charged for reservation as the number of accommodated persons increases with some exception such as host accommodating as much as 9 guests.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty type, host location and price summary:\n\n\nExpensive locations.\nGiven that there are locations with very small number of host e.i less than 4 hosts, for this analysis only locations with a minimum of 5 host will be included.\n\n\nPriceWeekly PriceMonthly PriceSecurity DepositCleaning Fee\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nLooking at the top 10 highest median reservation cost, Downtown Crossing in Boston, Cambridge, Boston, West End, Boston top the chart and given that all three locations have less number of host compare to other locations, one of the reasons for such high price can be lack of competitions from other “airbnb” service providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe highest weekly median reservation charge was from cambridge, Boston, it cost roughly 1,733 more for a weekly reservation than other locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nJust like per night prices of reservation, median monthly cost of booking an accommodation is much higher in Downtown Crossing, Boston where the median is 9,500 and Cambridge, Boston costing 7,200.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nExtra deposit for security measures cost more in West Roxbury, Boston, Chinatown, Boston & Charlestown, Boston $200 more than other locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe median charges for cleaning services is higher in Cambridge, Boston as it cost $19 more than other locations.\n\n\n\nOverall reservation cost are more expensive in locations such as Downtown Crossing, cambridge and Chinatown while extra charges on security and sanitation cost more in cambridge. furthermore it is also important to note that the number of hosts present in the above listed locations are quite few compared to other locations.\n\n\n\n\nProperty type and reservation cost:\nThe type of property is one of the major features guests look out for when making a decision as it impact certain amount of comfortability and also the cost of making a reservation.
